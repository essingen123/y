  <body><h1>YouTube Video Downloader and Converter to MP3</h1>
<p>A Python script to download YouTube videos and convert them to MP3 format.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<ul>
<li>This script is for educational purposes only.</li>
<li>It is intended to be used only if you have the rights to use it according to YouTube's terms of service and applicable laws.</li>
<li>If you own the material, you may still be subject to license agreements and other restrictions that prohibit downloading or converting your own content.</li>
<li>Use of this script may be subject to YouTube's policies on scraping, downloading, and converting content.</li>
<li>In no event shall the authors or maintainers of this script be liable for any damages or consequences arising from its use, including but not limited to:<ul>
<li>Copyright infringement</li>
<li>License agreement breaches</li>
<li>Intergalactic copyright disputes in the year 3050</li>
<li>Any other unforeseen consequences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By using this script, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and will use the script responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.x</li>
<li>pytube library (<code>pip install pytube</code>)</li>
<li>ffmpeg (for audio conversion)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Run the script in a Docker container for best results.</li>
<li>Provide the YouTube video URL as a command-line argument or input it when prompted.</li>
<li>The script will download the video and convert it to MP3 format.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>This script may not work consistently due to changes in YouTube's URL patterns.</li>
<li>A function to fix these patterns is included, but it may require manual updates.</li>
<li><strong>Caution:</strong> The script attempts to modify <code>cipher.py</code> to fix patterns. This may have unintended consequences. Use at your own risk.</li>
<li><strong>Warning:</strong> Running this script may interact with uncontrolled third-party tools. Use a sandboxed container for this script.</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> Due to frequent changes in the YouTube frontend, some JavaScript code may not match with this version of pytube. This may cause issues with video downloads.</li>
<li><strong>Work in Progress:</strong> This script is a work in progress and may not work as expected. Future updates may include an automatic hook for fixing <code>cipher.py</code> using a Large Language Model (LLM) like LLaMA 405B or Groq (Llama-3.1-70b-versatile) to dynamically update the cipher in real-time.</li>
</ul>
